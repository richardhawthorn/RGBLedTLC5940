TLC5940 RGB led driver
============

Arduino code written to mix rgb led channels using the TLC5940 pwm led driver chip.

The code rotates through several patterns, and gives examples of how to mix colours.

Use the function lightRgb(light, colour) to select an led (light) and a colour.  The colour variable should be a number between 0 and 1024, which represents the full spectrum of colours.
